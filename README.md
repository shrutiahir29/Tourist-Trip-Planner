Smart Tourist Trip Planner

Technologies Used: Python (Flask), HTML, CSS, Matplotlib, NetworkX
Algorithms Used: Dijkstra’s, Kruskal’s, and Hamiltonian (TSP)

📖 Project Overview

This project, Smart Tourist Trip Planner, is a web-based application that helps users plan an optimized travel route among multiple tourist destinations.

It combines three fundamental algorithms from Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA):

🚗 Dijkstra’s Algorithm – Finds the shortest distance between tourist attractions.

🏗️ Kruskal’s Algorithm – Builds a minimum spanning network to connect all attractions with minimal cost.

🌍 Hamiltonian Cycle (TSP) – Generates an optimal circular tour covering all attractions and returning to the start (like a full-day tour).

The system simulates realistic travel planning by generating random distances between locations and visually representing the routes.

💡 Real-Life Applications

Used in Google Travel, MakeMyTrip, and TripAdvisor to plan efficient travel itineraries.

Can be extended for logistics, delivery optimization, and emergency route planning.

⚙️ Features

✅ Interactive web interface built using Flask
✅ Travel-friendly colorful design
✅ Dynamic random distance generation
✅ Optimized route visualization with NetworkX + Matplotlib
✅ Easy to use — no external API required

🧩 Algorithms Explanation
Algorithm	Purpose	Description
Dijkstra’s	Find shortest path	Computes the minimum distance from a source attraction to all others.
Kruskal’s	Build minimal network	Forms a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) connecting attractions at lowest total cost.
Hamiltonian Cycle (TSP)	Full circular tour	Finds the shortest possible tour that visits every attraction once and returns to start.

🎨 Visualization Example

Orange Nodes → Tourist attractions

Gray Edges → All possible travel connections

Red Path → Optimal tour generated by TSP

Edge Labels → Distances between places

🚀 Future Enhancements

Integrate Google Maps API for real-world distances
